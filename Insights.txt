1. Sample Data
The first part shows a sample of five rows from the dataset. Each row represents a drug and contains columns such as:

drug_name	medical_condition	drug_link	medical_condition_url
doxycycline	Acne	Link	Link
spironolactone	Acne	Link	Link
minocycline	Acne	Link	Link
Accutane	Acne	Link	Link
clindamycin	Acne	Link	Link
Observations:

The dataset includes drug names and their corresponding medical conditions.
Each drug has a URL link for further details.
2. Missing Values in Each Column
The next section shows the count of missing values for each column. Example:

Column Name	Missing Values
side_effects	124
generic_name	43
drug_classes	82
brand_names	1213
pregnancy_category	229
alcohol	1554
related_drugs	1469
rating	1345
no_of_reviews	1345
Observations:

Many missing values in the "rating" and "no_of_reviews" columns indicate that several drugs have no user feedback.
Side effects and drug classes also have missing data, which could affect data analysis if not handled.
3. Summary Statistics of Numeric Columns

Observations:

The average drug rating is 3.69 out of 10, with a wide range of ratings.
Fifty percent of drugs have a rating of 3.3 or below, meaning many drugs have poor user feedback.
